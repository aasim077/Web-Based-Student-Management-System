Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to develop a Student Management System (SMS) can provide a solution to the difficulties that educational institutions face in managing and organizing student information. Some of the specific ways that Beanstalk can solve these problems include:

Centralized and Automated Management: Beanstalk provides a platform for deploying and managing web applications, which can be used to create a centralized system for managing student information. This eliminates the need for manual data entry and makes it easy to access and update student records.
Scalability: Beanstalk automatically handles scaling and load balancing, ensuring that the SMS can handle a large number of users, even during peak usage. This is especially important for larger educational institutions.
Integration with other AWS services: Beanstalk can be integrated with other AWS services such as RDS for database management, S3 for storage, and CloudWatch for monitoring. This allows for robust data storage and management capabilities.

Easy Deployment and Management: Beanstalk makes it easy to deploy, run and manage web applications, which allows developers to focus on building the SMS application rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.
Monitoring and Logging: Beanstalk provides monitoring and logging features, allowing administrators to track the performance of the SMS and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
Mobile accessibility: Beanstalk allows for mobile accessibility of the SMS, making it easy for students, teachers, and admin to access student information and perform tasks from anywhere. Overall, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a solution to the difficulties in managing student information by providing a platform for building a centralized, scalable and easy-to-manage SMS.

1.1 Student Management refers to the process of organizing, managing, and keeping track of the information and activities related to students in an educational institution. It involves a wide range of tasks such as maintaining student records, tracking student progress, managing student schedules and assignments, and generating reports on student activity. Student management systems can be either manual or computerized. Manual systems typically involve paper records and spreadsheets, while computerized systems use specialized software to manage and organize student data. A computerized system can provide many benefits over manual systems, such as improved data accuracy, better reporting capabilities, and more efficient data sharing between different departments and staff members. The design and implementation of a comprehensive student information system and user interface is to replace the current paper records [1]. College Staff can directly access all aspects of a student’s academic progress through a secure, online interface embedded in the college’s website. The system utilizes user authentication, displaying only information necessary for an individual’s duties. Additionally, each sub-system has authentication allowing authorized users to create or update information in that subsystem. All data is thoroughly reviewed and validated on the server before actual record alteration occurs. In addition to a staff user interface, the system plans for a student user interface, allowing users to access information and submit requests online thus reducing processing time. All data is stored securely on SQL servers managed by the college administrator and ensures the highest possible level of security. The system features a complex logging system to track all user's access and ensure conformity to data access guidelines and is expected to increase the efficiency of the college’s record management thereby decreasing the work hours needed to access and deliver student records to users.

Applications A Student Management System (SMS) application is a software tool designed to help educational institutions manage and organize student information. It typically includes a range of features such as:
• Student Information Management: Allows administrators to store and update student profiles, including personal information, contact details, and academic records.
• Attendance Management: Allows teachers to track student attendance and generate reports on attendance patterns. • Grading and Assessment: Allows teachers to track student progress, record grades, and generate reports on student performance. 
• Scheduling: Allows administrators to create class schedules and assign teachers to classes. • Communication: Allows teachers and administrators to communicate with students and parents through email, messaging, or other tools. • Reporting: Generates reports on student activity and performance, which can be used for analysis and planning. • Mobile accessibility: SMS applications can be accessed from mobile devices which makes it easy for students, teachers, and admin to keep track of their data and activities. 
• Integration with other systems: SMS can be integrated with other systems like payment gateway, library management system, and more.

1.2 AWS Elastic Beanstalk AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to deploy, run, and scale web applications and services. It abstracts away many of the underlying infrastructure details, making it simple for developers to quickly deploy and run their applications without worrying about provisioning servers or configuring load balancers. With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can simply upload their application code and Beanstalk will automatically handle the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the application. Beanstalk supports a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, and Go. It also integrates with other AWS services such as Amazon RDS for database management, Amazon S3 for storage, and Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring. Additionally, Beanstalk allows you to easily configure and manage the underlying infrastructure of your application, such as the number of EC2 instances, the size of the instances, and the load balancer settings. It also provides monitoring and logging features, allowing you to track the performance of your application and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Overall, Elastic Beanstalk is a powerful tool for deploying and managing web applications and services, making it easy for developers to focus on building great applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

1.3 Problem Definition The problem that Student Management faces is the difficulties that educational institutions face in managing and organizing student information. The following are some specific problems that an SMS can address:

Dispersed and redundant information: Without a centralized system, student information is often stored in multiple locations, making it difficult to access and maintain. This can lead to inconsistencies and errors in student records.
Time-consuming data collection: Gathering relevant information about a student, such as attendance records, grades, and contact information, can take a lot of time when using manual methods.
Inefficient communication: Without an SMS, it can be difficult for teachers, administrators, and parents to communicate effectively.
Limited reporting capabilities: Without an SMS, it can be difficult to generate reports on student activity and performance, which are necessary for analysis and planning.
Difficulty in handling a large number of students: With an increasing number of students, it is becoming increasingly difficult for educational institutions to manage student information manually.
